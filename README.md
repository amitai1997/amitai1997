I am a backend software developer, constantly seeking ways to implement innovative technologies in real-life scenarios. After completing my military service, where I received software development training, I was deployed as a software developer, DevOps engineer, and infrastructure specialist.

Over the past three years, I have acquired valuable experience building numerous projects. In addition, I worked as a freelancer, delivering software development and DevOps engineering services to a diverse range of clients. This has provided me with expertise in AWS cloud services, various tools, and backend development.

During my leisure time, I enjoy creating personal projects, expanding my knowledge, and exploring emerging technologies.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python (Django), JS (Node) and Coffeescript 
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on creating web applications.
- ðŸ˜€ I like to play the piano, code, read, and draw in my free time.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about movies and TV serieses.
- âš¡ Fun fact: My first line of code was not "Hello World!"
